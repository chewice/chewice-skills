# Advisor Atlas data-contract router

Boss Hunting uses `project.json` schemaVersion 10; `status.json` and researched
output records remain version 2. Structured JSON is authoritative and Markdown
state files are compact resumable summaries.

Load only the contract needed by the active stage:

- Read [core-data-contract.md](core-data-contract.md) before bootstrap, Finder,
  Evaluator, or any write to shared advisor/program/evidence/status records.
- Read [investigation-contract.md](investigation-contract.md) only for the
  Detective selection gate, confirmation, execution, result validation, or
  migration of legacy Detective state.
- Read [application-materials-contract.md](application-materials-contract.md)
  only when offering, confirming, generating, resuming, or validating an RP or
  outreach email.

Cross-stage invariants:

- Join by stable IDs, never fuzzy names or array position.
- Reuse current field-level evidence; query only missing, stale, or conflicting
  fields. Never convert skipped work or extraction/access failure to
  `not_found`.
- Store program facts once and join them to advisor-program rows.
- Use the bundled initializer and confirmation scripts instead of hand-writing
  schema, fingerprints, revisions, or migration state.
- A valid project CV is project-scoped and reused across phases. Do not ask for
  another upload unless it is missing, unreadable, a sample, belongs to another
  applicant, or the user asks to replace it.
- Medical discovery uses the three-step research profile (field → disease /
  mechanism / question → regions) without a CV, grades, skills or desired
  training. Medical application accepts relevant sourced structured background;
  RP/outreach retain their original CV and exact-target gates. General projects
  keep their defaults.
- Medical comparisons use the five-dimension evidence profile (research-question
  fit, route continuity, PI role confidence, evidence sufficiency, current
  activity) with five public-evidence modules A–E, not weighted scores, reach
  quotas, training fit, resources, doctoral funding or training environment.
  Unmapped advisors remain advisor-level discovery records, never fake programs.
- Medical subagents write only `runs/<run-id>/subagents/*.json`; the Main Agent
  merges them with `merge_subagent_findings.mjs`, the single writer of
  `outputs/advisor_records.json` and `outputs/evidence.json` for that merge.
  Credential values never enter any record; `runs/<run-id>/provider-capabilities.json`
  stores status words and routes only.
- Never insert demonstration records or infer unknown user inputs.
